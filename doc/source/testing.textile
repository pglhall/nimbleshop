h3. Installing firefox for selenium tests


nimbleShop uses selenium for acceptance tests. I found that firefox 11 does not play well with selenium. So here are the steps to follow to get selenium tests running on your machine

* If you are using firefox 11 then uninstall it .
* Download (but do not install) firefox 10 from "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7468116/Firefox%2010.0.dmg":http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7468116/Firefox%2010.0.dmg .
* Now turn off internet connection .
* Install firefox 10 .
* Open firefox and go to preferences > Advanced > Update . Check the radio button "Never check for updates". Close preference panel .
* Turn internet on .
* Now run tests for selenium .
